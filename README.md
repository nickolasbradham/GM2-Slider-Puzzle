# GM2-Slider-Puzzle
A extremely basic slider puzzle game made in Game Maker that allows you to pick the image.

When you run the game it will display a open dialogue for you to select the image to use. Then it will ask how many slices to make on the horizontal and vertical axis. Then hit "Go" to start the puzzle. It will scramble the tiles and you can move one into the blank space with the arrow keys.
